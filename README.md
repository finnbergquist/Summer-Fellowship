Skream Sauce by Finn Bergquist ’22

Research Abstract: My goal was to create a digital musical device to assist my musical expression on guitar.
I took inspiration from guitar pedals, musical loopers, and samplers to create Skream Sauce – a hardware sample
player and looper. I researched digital-analog conversion, audio compression, and audio amplification. I learned
the circuitry necessary to interface with the Raspberry Pi computer. By studying online schematics, I wrote the
code necessary to run Skream Sauce’s basic operating procedures. With a functional prototype, I designed and 
3D-printed an enclosure, Photo-shopped a design for the exterior, and coated the device with a translucent 
finish. My research inspired me to continue developing my technical skills to the point where I can contribute
to the growing music technology field with my own digital instruments.
